## Description
This project enables the user to .

## Setup/Installation Requirements 
* Open "triangle-tracker" directory on terminal 
* initialize the project on git
* Go to github and create a new repository
* create a remote repository on your computer using terminal
* Push the directory on github
* create a branch gh-pages and push the directory once more using gh-pages as the branch.
* Go to github click environment and click to view the website.
* open your web-browser
* copy the following URL into your search :wambita.github.io/triangle-tracker
### BDD
In order for the program to run well and to give the correct output, the code had to meet certain criteria
1. The values entered have to be numbers
2. For the triangle to be called " Equilateral" all sides have to be equal
3. For the triangle to be called "Isoceles" any two sides have to be equal
4. For the triangle to be called "scalene", No side has to be equal and the sum of two sides must be greater than the third.
5. For a triangle to be called a triangle the sum of two sides of the triangle MUST NOT be less than or equal to the third.
Below is a table to describe this:

Behavior                  | Input Example|  Output Example
------------------------  | -------------|  --------------
3 equal values            | 7, 7, 7      | Equilateral Triangle
2 equal values            | 7, 7, 10     | Isoceles Triangle
No equal values but a+b>c | 3, 4, 5      | Scalene Triangle
No equal values but a+b<c | 4,3,9        | NOT a TRIANGLE
No equal values but a+b=c | 5,7,12       |NOT a TRIANGLE
## Known Bugs
There are no known Bugs
## Technologies Used
* I used HTML to create the website and CSS to style the website.
* I used visual studio code to create the portfolio readme 
* I used JavaScript to write the code that will enable the application program to run
