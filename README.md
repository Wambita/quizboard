### BDD
In order for the program to run well and to give the correct output, the code had to meet certain criteria
1. The user had to pick a choice from the list provided 
2. For the answer to be correct the value of the label has to be five.
Below is a table to describe this:

Behavior                  | Input Example|  Output Example
------------------------  | -------------|  --------------
 Five correct answers     | 7, 7, 7      | 100%
